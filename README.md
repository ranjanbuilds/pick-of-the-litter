# Pick of the Litter
‘Pick of the Litter’ was created alongside Joy Liu and Drew Thompson. The app lets you search for local pet shelters and filter by dog preference (i.e. size, age and gender). Using JavaScript, we make calls to Petfinder’s API and use the Leaflet interactive map library. The dynamic filtering feature and the clean UX is something we are really proud of.
